# Hawke's AILCPH

Hawke's Artificial Intellgence Large Context Project Helper.

Back around 2005-2020, and again in 2021-2025, I would periodically pick up and set down, work on what would become the [AI Large Context Project Helper (AILCPH)](https://www2.techtalkhawke.com/news/building-dgpunet-democratizing-ai-innovation-through-open-source-infrastructure) tool, which would later evolve into SIIMPAF (the interactive UI to AILCPH), and its capabilities expanded considerably with the DGPUNET.

The initial goal was managing large technical projects with extensive documentation, dependencies, and complex requirements. Projects with hundreds or thousands of files, multiple interdependent components, and documentation that needed to stay synchronized with code.

This is a key component related to, though it can function standalone without either, of the SIIMPAF and DGPUNET projects.

Originally started around 2008 or so, to try to help me manage the many projects I was juggling, more effectively.

The capabilities of this tool are impacted by the underlying hardware that this is running on (especially GPU VRAM, though it can use CPU and system RAM (at slower rates)). Its full capabilities are realized when integrated with the DGPUNET, and the UI enhancements of the SIIMPAF.

The expanded context and session management capabilities that AILCPH provides work much more effectively when backed by distributed resources that can handle large knowledge archives and maintain persistent context across extended sessions.

Initially in 1998, 2002, 2008, 2010, 2015, and significantly updated in 2020 and 2025, I started work specifically focused on managing large technical projects - codebases with thousands of files, extensive documentation, complex dependencies.

The problem: How do you help someone understand and work with a project that's too large to keep entirely in mind? How do you answer questions like "Where is feature X implemented?" or "What documentation relates to this bug?" when the answer might span multiple files and require understanding context?

Solutions required:
- Ingesting and indexing large document sets
- Understanding semantic relationships between documents
- Fast search across both exact matches and conceptual similarity
- Managing context across long interactions
- Tracking decisions and rationale over time

This required vector databases, semantic search, local AI models, and efficient document processing - technologies that were becoming practical for self-hosted deployment.

Back around 1998-2020, and again in 2021-2025, I would periodically pick up and set down, work on what would become the AI Large Context Project Helper (AILCPH), which would later evolve into SIIMPAF.

The initial goal was managing large technical projects with extensive documentation, dependencies, and complex requirements. Projects with hundreds or thousands of files, multiple interdependent components, and documentation that needed to stay synchronized with code.

Core capabilities:

- Ingesting and indexing large document sets
- Understanding relationships between documents
- Answering questions about project structure and dependencies
- Suggesting relevant documentation when code changes
- Tracking decisions and rationale over time
- Helping new contributors understand project context
- AI Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Project-wide storage, retrieval, sourcing, searching, understanding, and trying to get to actual grokking (which AI LLMs DO NOT DO!)

This requires:

- Document processing and chunking strategies
- Vector databases for semantic search
- Local AI models for understanding and generation
- Efficient indexing and retrieval
- Context management across long interactions
- Complex chaining
- Chain-failure fault-tolerance resilience
- Meaningful clarity in error messaging when "something goes wrong"
- Large context capacity, but more than just raw capacity, actually trying to get the tool to grok the project meaningfully

The patterns from decades of previous work converged here:

- Early tabletop role-playing games exposing complex systems and coming up with working solutions
- Natural language processing from IRC bots and chatbots
- Distributed computing from Beowulf clusters and WISP infrastructure
- Real-time processing from LearningMate
- Reliability requirements from production systems
- Integration of multiple open-source components
